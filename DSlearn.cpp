// Introduction
// Data Strcutures is way to arrange data in main memory (RAM) for efficient usage
// Algorithm --> sequence of steps to solve a given problem
// Data Structures are crucial for efficient memory management

// Database: A database is a collection of information for faster retrieval and updation (in HDD)
// Data Warehousing: Management of huge amount of legacy data for better analysis
// CRUD: Create Read Update Delete

// BigData: Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software

// Memory Layout of C Programs

// 1. Heap
// 2. Stack 
// 3. Data Segment (Global and Static Variables)
// 4. Code Segment 

// Function stack frame gets destroyed once it is returned

/*Space and Time Complexity*/

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    // printf("Python\n");
    return 0;
    
}
