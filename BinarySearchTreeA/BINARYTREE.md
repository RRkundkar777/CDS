# Binary Tree

Since a BST is a special binary tree, it is relevant to study Binary Tree

## What is a Binary Tree?
```
A binary tree is a tree having degree atmost 2.
That is, every node in binary tree can have atmost 2 children.

## Number of Binary Trees that can be formed with n nodes

### Case1: Nodes are identical
If the nodes are identical, the number of binary trees that can be formed are:
    <sup>2n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>

![\Large \frac{<sup>2n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a})
