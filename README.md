# Data Structures and Algorithms
My Repository containing the Data Structures and Algorithms I learnt.

## Why algorithms?

- A computer is a dumb piece of hardware that needs to be instructed by the programmer.
- This set of instructions is called a program.
- An algorithm is a finite set of well defined steps, designed to perform a specific task.
- A computer program contains one or more than one algorithm implemented in it.

## Data Structures

- Data Structure is a way of organising data in computer for efficient access and management

## Why Data Structures?
- Data Structures are the essential ingredients of an efficient algorithm.
- An algorithm may work faster or slower depending upon the organisation of data in computer.

## Space Complexity of an Algorithm
### Auxiliary Space
```
Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.
For Example,  Swapping of two variables requires a 'temp' variable.
