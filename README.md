# Data Structures and Algorithms
My Repository containing the Data Structures and Algorithms I learnt.

## Why algorithms?

- A computer is a dumb piece of hardware that needs to be instructed by the programmer.
- This set of instructions is called a program.
- An algorithm is a finite set of well defined steps, designed to perform a specific task.
- A computer program contains one or more than one algorithm implemented in it.

## Data Structures

- Data Structure is a way of organising data in computer for efficient access and management

## Why Data Structures?
- Data Structures are the essential ingredients of an efficient algorithm.
- An algorithm may work faster or slower depending upon the organisation of data in computer.

## Space Complexity of an Algorithm
### Auxiliary Space
```
Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.
For Example, swapping of two variables requires an extra 'temp' variable.
```
```
Space Complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the
input size. 
It includes both Auxiliary space and the space used by input. 
```
Space complexity is the study of efficiency of algorithms.

In present world, having a terrabyte disk space is very common. Therefore space complexity is
of little significance.


## Time Complexity of an algorithm
Like space complexity, the time complexity is also a study of efficiency of algorithms.
```
Time complexity is the study of growth of execution time of algorithm with respect to
the size of input.
As most the algorithms are of the format Input --> Process --> Output, the Time complexity
measures the time of Process as a function of Input.
