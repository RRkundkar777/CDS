# Data Structures and Algorithms
My Repository containing the Data Structures and Algorithms I learnt.

## Why algorithms?

- A computer is a dumb piece of hardware that needs to be instructed by the programmer.
- This set of instructions is called a program.
- An algorithm is a finite set of well defined steps, designed to perform a specific task.
